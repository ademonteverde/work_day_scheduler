# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This Daily Planner is a web-based application designed to help users create and manage their daily schedules effectively. It includes the following features:

- **Current Day Display**: The current date is prominently displayed at the top of the calendar.

- **Time Blocks**: Time blocks for standard business hours are presented as you scroll down the page.

- **Color Coding**: Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future based on the current time of day.

- **Event Entry**: You can click into a time block to enter and edit events for that specific hour.

- **Local Storage**: When you click the save button for a time block, the event text is saved in local storage, ensuring your schedule persists even after refreshing the page.

## Usage

1. Open the planner in your web browser.
